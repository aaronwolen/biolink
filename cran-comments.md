## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated the package Name, Title and Description to better communicate that its
  focus is on biological databases
* Edited the description to omit the redundant "This package provides functions
  for..."

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.3.2
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.2.5,R 3.3.2,R-devel
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
