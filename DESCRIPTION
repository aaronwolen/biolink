Title: Create Hyperlinks to Biological Databases and Resources
Description: Generate urls and hyperlinks to commonly used biological databases
    and resources based on standard identifiers. This is primarily useful when
    writing dynamic reports that reference things like gene symbols in text or
    tables, allowing you to, for example, convert gene identifiers to hyperlinks
    pointing to their entry in the NCBI Gene database. Currently supports NCBI
    Gene, PubMed, Gene Ontology, CRAN and Bioconductor.
