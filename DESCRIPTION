Title: Create Hyperlinks to Online Databases and Resources
Description: linkit provides functions for generating urls and hyperlinks to
    commonly used online databases and resources. This is primarily useful when
    writing dynamic reports that reference things like gene symbols in text or
    tables, allowing you to, for example, convert gene identifiers to hyperlinks
    pointing to their entry in the NCBI Gene database.
